#COMPONENTS OF HADOOP ECOSYSTEM

DATA INGESTION = SQOOP , FLUEME
DATA STORAGE= S3, HDFS
DATA PROCESSING= HADOOP MAPREDUCE(YARN),APACHE SPARK(CLUSTER MGMT)
DATA ANALYSIS= HIVE,PIG,IMPALA
DATA EXPLORATION= CLOUDERA SEARCH,HUE,OZZIE
DATA VISUALIZATION= TABLEAU

HDFS=PROVIDE storage layer for hadoop,suitable for distributed storage and processing,streaming access to 
file system data,provide file permission and authentication,provides a cli to interact with  HDFS.

HBASE= STORE DATA IN HDFS,HBASE IS  A NOSQL OR NON RELATIONAL DATABASE,MAINLY USED WHEN YOU NEED RANDOM
real time,read/write access to your big data ,provide support to high volume of data and high throughput

SQOOP : A TOOL TO DESIGNED TO TRANSFER DATA BETWEEN HADOOP AND RELATIONAL DATABASE SERVER
IT IS  used to import data from RELATIONAL DATABASEs such as oracle and mysql to hdfs and export data from hdfs to relational databases

FLUEME=if you want to ingest event data such as streaming data ,ensor data  or log files you can use FLUME.
IDEALLY SUITED for event data from multiple system,a distributed service for ingesting streaming data

SPARK= open source cluster computing framework,provide 100 times faster performance than mapreduce,
support machine learning and batch processing

SPARK HAS FOLLOWING MAIN COMPONENTS

SPARK CORE AND RESILLIENT DISTRIBUTED DATASETS(RDDs),SPARK SQL,SPARK STREAMING ,MLIib,GRAPHX

HADOOP=THE ORIGINAL hadoop processing engine which is primarily java based,based on the map and reduce programming model
,an extensive and fault tolerance framework,commonly used

PIG=AN open source dataflow system,used mainly for analysis, converts pig scripts to map reduce code
,ana alternative to writing map reduce code,best for ad hoc queries such as join and filter

IMPALA=HIGH PERFORMANCE sql engine WHICH RUNS ON HADOP CLUSTER, IDEAL FOR INTERACTIVE ANALYSIS,
,very low latency-measured in miliseconds,support a dialect of sql(impala sql)

HIVE= SIMILAR TO IMPALA,BEST FOR DATA PROCESSING AND ETL,execute querries using mapreduce,

CLOUDERA SEARCH= one of cloudera near real time access product,enable non tech users to search and explore data stored in or ingested into hadoop and hbase
,a fully integrated data processing platform,eliminate the need to move large datasets across infrastructures to address business tasks

OOZIE= is a workflow and coordination system used to manage the hadoop jobs

HUE(Hadoop user experience)=open source web interface for analyzing data with hadoop,it provides SQL editor for hive,impala,mysql,oracle,postgreSQL,spark SQL,AND SOLARSQL
text interface for exploring data.

commercial HADOOP DISTRIBUTION= cloudera,hortonworks,mapr,AMAZON EMR,AZURE HDInsight

#BIG DATA PROCESSING
1.ingest      = flume,oozie
2.processing  = hadoop,hbase,hadoop mapreduce,spark
3.analyze     = hive,impala,pig
4.access      = hue,cloudera

#HDFS & YARN
hdfs IS A DISTRIBUTED FILE SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES ACCESS TO DATA ACROSS HADOOP CLUSTER
,CLUSTER IS A GROUP OF COMPUTERS,HDFS MANAGES AND SUPPORTS ANALYSIS OF very large volume of big data

traditional system challenges = cost ,speed ,reliability,

HDFS RESOLVES ALL 3 MAJOR ISSUES
HDFS COPIES DATA MULTIPLE TIMES,HADOOP CLUSTER READ OR WRITE MORE THAN ONE TB DATA IN A SECOND,ZERO LICENSING AND SUPPORT COST

FOR EXample a person donates book to library,librarian decides to arrange the books on a smaal rack,also he distributes multiple copies of each book on other racks
for easy access.

HDFS HAS 128MB -LARGE BLOCK OF DATA ,WHILE TRADITIONAL FILE SYSTEM HAS 5 SMALL BYTES OF DATA,
ACCESS TO LARGE DATA IN HDFS READS HUGE DATA SEQUENTIALLY IN A SINGLE OPERATION,WHILE IN traditional file system suffers form disk i/o problem
coz of multiple seek operation
