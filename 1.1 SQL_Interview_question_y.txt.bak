Q. DIFFERENCE between delete ,truncate,drop
Q. difference between where  and having
Q. difference between group by and order by

LEVEL 2
Q. difference between CHAR AND varchar
Q. difference between union and join
Q. difference between in & exist
Q. how to create empty table with the same structure as another table
select * INTO students_copy from students where 1=2(false conditon 1=2)
Q what is pattern matching in sql
select * form students where name LIKE '_k%'; --SECOND LETTER IS K,% MEANS ANTYHING AFTER THAT
Q. WHAT IS UNION MINUS INTERSECT
union -combines, intersect- means common between both tables will be printed,minus all records from student table which are not in contacts table will be printed
--select name from students UNION select name from contacts  

Q difference between union and union all
 union print only once, union all can print duplicates
 
Q what is a view 
virtual table :   from customers where country='India';

Q character manipulation function
UPPER,LOWER,INITCAP,LENGTH,CONCAT

level 3
NORMAL FOEMS

1. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHERE v/s HAVING
1.WHERE 
-filter rows
-works on rows data ,not on aggregated data
select * from employee here score>40;
2.HAVING
-works on aggregated data
AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
- TO perform calculation on multiple  rows of a single column
-it returns a single value
-it is used to summarize data 
-count,max,min,avg,summarize
-having and group by used in agggregate function
select max(salary) from employee having emp_id>=15

2. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UNION v/s UNION ALL
UNION - REMOVES duplicate records
UNION ALLL-  does not remove duplicate
--union operator combines rsult set of 2 or more select statement
--each select stmt must have
1.same number coln
2.coln must have similar data type
3.coln must be in same order

3. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IN v/s EXIST
1.IN -> multiple or 
select * from customers where city='mumbai' or city='banglore' or city='chennai'
can be converted into like this querry
select * from customers where city IN (MUMBAI,BANGLORE,CHENNAI);
2.EXIST-> returns true or false
select * from customers where EXISTS (select city from where table2.id=customer.id)
USECASE
--IN->  bIG OUTER QUERRY AND SMALL INNER QUERRY
--EXISTS-> SMALL OUTER QUERRY and big inner querry
--IN-> Compare one value to several value
--EXISTS->tells you wheather a querry returned any result

4. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ORDER BY  v/s GROUP BY
ORDER BY-> SORTING,ASC OR DSC
GROUP BY-> USED WITH AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
*'GROUP' BY FOLLOWS 'where' clause in 'select' statement
*'WHERE' Cannot be used after group by 
*'HAVING' IS USED AFTER group by 

4. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JOIN  v/s SUBQUERY
-both are used to combine data from different tables into a single result
---SUBQUERRY
SELECT phone, cust_name from customers where cust_id IN
(select cust_id from orders);
-can select only from first table
-slower
---JOIN 
SELECT phone, cust_name,ORDER_ID from customers c JOIN orders o on c.cust_id=o.cust_id;
-can select form either of the table
-faster

4. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JOIN  v/s UNION
---union
-cobines rows
-not neccessary to have same column name
-but no. of column & datatype of column should be same
---JOIN
-MERGES column
-combines rows from 2 or more tables based on a related common column between them

Q. how to delete duplicate rows from a table in SQL.
4 following ways are shown:
1) remove duplicate rows using a temporary table
2) remove duplicate rows using auto ID
3) remove duplicate rows using row_number()
4) remove duplicate rows using CTE

1.USING TEMP TABLE
-SELECT distinct * INTO NEW_TABLE FROM OLD_TABLE
-DELETE * FORM OLD_TABLE or TRUNCATE
-INSERT INTO OLD_TABLE SELECT * FROM NEW_TABLE
-DROP TABLE NEW_TABLE

2. USING AUTO_ID
-ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE ADD auto_id int IDENTITY(1,1)
-delete 8 from employee where auto_id NOT IN (SELECT min(auto_id)
from employee group by emp_id ,emp_name)

3.using row number
delete from (select 8, row_number() OVER(PARTITION BY ID Order by id) as rn from mytable)
 where rn>1
 
4.USING CTE (COMMON TABLE EXPRESSION)
-used as a temporary result set
-lasts only for duration for the querry

WITH cte as (select row_number() over(partition by id order by id) as rn from mytable)
delete from cte rn>1

5. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DELETE  v/s TRUNCATE
---DELETE 
-DML ,DELETE REMOVEs some  or all rows 
-it does not free space containing the table
-the transaction log will still have the deleted rows
-slower than truncate
---TRUNCATE
-DDL,removes all the rows from the table 
-it frees up space containing the table
-no where clause can be used
---DROP
-removes table from the database
-cannot be rolled up
#Q1.increase income of all employees by 5% in a table
update employees SET income=income+(income * 5.0/100.0);


#find names of employees starting with 'A'
select first_name fro employees where  first_name LIKE 'A%';

#Q3. find no. of employees working in department 'ABC'
SELECT COUNT FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE department_name='ABC';

#Q4. PRINT DETAILS OF EMPLOYEES WHOSE FIRST_NAME END WITH 'A' AND CONTAINS 6 alphabets
select * from employees where first_name LIKE '______A'

#Q5.print details of employees whose salary lies between 10000 and 50000
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE SALARY BETWEEN 10000 AND 50000

Q8.difference BETWEEN CHAR V/S VARCHAR
VARCHAR->variable length
char->fixed length
---char
-uses stTIC MEMORY ALLOCATION
-FIXED length
-faster
---VARCHAR
-it uses dynamic memory location
-variable length
-better for storage
-slower
-has an overhead of 2 bytes
---char->telephone no,zip code, etc
---varchar->names
Q. fetch to n recordsselec top n* from employees order by salary desc

Q. retrive empfname,and emplname in a single column as 'fullname', first name ,last name 
seprated with space
--select CONCAT(empfname,' ',emplname) as 'Fullname' from employees;
